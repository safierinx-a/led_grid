ADDITIONAL TIPS:
• Because of the limited resolution (25 × 24) and a 4–10 ft viewing distance, keep shapes bold with high-contrast edges.  
• Consider subtle transitions and smooth color gradients for mesmerizing displays; fast flickers can appear chaotic or over-stimulating.  
• Experiment with color theory (complementary, analogous, split-complementary) to ensure striking yet harmonious visuals.  
• Adjust brightness levels to find a comfortable and aesthetically pleasing glow without blinding viewers up close.  
• Use parameter controls (speeds, amplitude, color palette choices) to quickly iterate and discover new creative variations.
